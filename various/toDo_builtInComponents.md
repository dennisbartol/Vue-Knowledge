#### Vue Built In Components

Vue has a set of built-in components.

| Component |	Description |
-------
|<KeepAlive> |	Remembers the state of non-active dynamic components
|<Suspense> |	Used with asynchronous components to render the content of the fallback slot while waiting for the asynchronous component to resolve so that it can render the content of the default slot. Warning: This built-in component is experimental, and not globally supported.
|<Teleport>	| Moves an element to another place in the DOM structure
|<Transition>	| Animates an element as it is removed from, or added to, our application with v-if or v-show, or with dynamic components.
|<TransitionGroup> |	Animates elements that are added to our page with v-for

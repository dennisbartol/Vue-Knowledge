#### Directives 

Directives are a core feature in Vue 3 that provide a declarative way to interact with the DOM. They simplify tasks like binding data, managing events, and conditionally rendering content while keeping templates clean and readable. Whether you're using built-in directives or creating custom ones, they are essential for building dynamic, interactive applications with Vue.

<p>The following directives are available:</p>

#### The public folder. 


In a Vue 3 project, the public folder is used to store static assets that you want to be served directly without processing by Webpack or Vite. This folder is meant for files that don’t need to be bundled or transformed during the build process.

What you need to know about the public folder:

**Characteristics of the public folder**

**1. Direct Serving:** Files in the public folder are served at the root of the project. For example, if you have a file logo.png in public, it will be accessible at /logo.png in the browser.


**2. No Processing:** Assets in this folder are not processed by Vue’s build tools (e.g., Webpack or Vite). This means:

- No minification, hashing, or other optimizations are applied.

- References to these files must use absolute paths or paths relative to the public folder’s root.



**3. Use Cases.** Typical use cases for the public folder include:

- Favicon or App Icons: Files like favicon.ico, apple-touch-icon.png, etc.

- Robots.txt: For search engine directives.

- Static JSON Files: For configurations or data that doesn’t change during runtime.

- External Resources: Files like fonts or images that don’t need to be part of the module bundling process.



**4. Accessibility:** During development, these files are accessible under the root / path of the dev server. In production, they are served at the root of the built application.

Example Structure

/public
  ├── favicon.ico
  ├── robots.txt
  ├── logo.png
  ├── data.json
```

**Accessing files in the public folder**

You reference these files in your code using absolute paths:

```
<img src="/logo.png" alt="Logo">
```

> Note: The leading / is necessary to ensure the path is resolved relative to the root of your project, both during development and after deployment.

&nbsp;

**In summary:** the public folder is ideal for assets that do not need to be processed by the build system and should be directly available in the final output of your application.

<h4>Lazy Loading</h4>

Lazy loading, in the context of website development, refers to a technique where <ins>resources (such as images, scripts, or content) are loaded asynchronously or on-demand, rather than loading everything upfront when the page initially loads</ins>. The purpose of lazy loading is to improve page performance, reduce initial loading times, and save bandwidth by deferring the loading of non-critical resources until they are needed.

Here's how lazy loading typically works for different types of resources:

<b>1. Image Lazy Loading:</b> With image lazy loading, images are loaded only when they come into view within the browser's viewport. This is particularly useful for web pages with many images or large images that may cause slow initial loading times. By loading images lazily, the initial page load time can be significantly reduced, improving the user experience. Popular JavaScript libraries like Intersection Observer API are often used to implement image lazy loading.

<b>2. Script Lazy Loading:</b> Lazy loading can also be applied to JavaScript files. Instead of loading all JavaScript files at once when the page loads, scripts can be loaded asynchronously or deferred until they are needed. This can be beneficial for improving initial page load times, especially for scripts that are not critical for rendering above-the-fold content. JavaScript modules and dynamic script loading techniques can be used to implement script lazy loading.

<b>3. Content Lazy Loading:</b> Lazy loading can also be applied to other types of content, such as text, videos, or entire sections of a webpage. Content can be loaded dynamically as the user scrolls down the page or interacts with certain elements, rather than loading all content upfront. This can help reduce the initial page load time and improve perceived performance, especially for long web pages with a lot of content.

<b>Overall, lazy loading is a performance optimization technique that helps improve website loading times, reduce bandwidth usage, and enhance the user experience by deferring the loading of non-critical resources until they are actually needed.</b>


<h4>The Intersection Observer API</h4>

The Intersection Observer API is a built-in feature of modern web browsers and is part of the JavaScript language specification. It is supported in most modern web browsers, including Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and others.

The Intersection Observer API provides a way to asynchronously observe changes in the intersection of a target element with an ancestor element or with a top-level document's viewport. This makes it useful for implementing lazy loading of images, infinite scrolling, and other dynamic behaviors based on element visibility.

<h4>Lazy Loading</h4>

Lazy loading, in the context of website development, refers to a technique where <ins>resources (such as images, scripts, or content) are loaded asynchronously or on-demand, rather than loading everything upfront when the page initially loads</ins>. The purpose of lazy loading is to improve page performance, reduce initial loading times, and save bandwidth by deferring the loading of non-critical resources until they are needed.

Here's how lazy loading typically works for different types of resources:

<b>1. Image Lazy Loading:</b> With image lazy loading, images are loaded only when they come into view within the browser's viewport. This is particularly useful for web pages with many images or large images that may cause slow initial loading times. By loading images lazily, the initial page load time can be significantly reduced, improving the user experience. Popular JavaScript libraries like Intersection Observer API are often used to implement image lazy loading.

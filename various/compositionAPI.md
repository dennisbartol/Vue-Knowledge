<h4>\V/ue Composition API</h4>

The Composition API is a feature introduced in Vue.js 3 that provides <ins>a new way to organize and reuse code logic in Vue components</ins>. It complements Vue's existing Options API by offering a more flexible and modular approach to defining component logic.


Here's the current landscape:

Function-based API: Unlike the Options API, which organizes component options such as data, methods, computed properties, etc., the Composition API is based on functions. Instead of defining component options as object properties, you define them as standalone functions.
Composable Functions: With the Composition API, you can define reusable logic in composable functions. These functions encapsulate related logic and can be easily reused across multiple components, promoting code organization and reusability.
Single Source of Truth: The Composition API promotes a single source of truth for component logic by allowing you to group related logic together in a single component. This makes it easier to understand and maintain complex components, as all related logic is located in one place.
Better TypeScript Support: The Composition API provides better support for TypeScript, making it easier to type-check and refactor code. TypeScript interfaces and types can be easily defined for composable functions, improving code maintainability and reliability.
Improved Code Organization: The Composition API allows you to organize component logic based on functionality rather than options. This can lead to more readable and maintainable code, especially for larger components or components with complex logic.

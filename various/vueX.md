<h4>VueX</h4>

Vuex is a state management pattern and library for Vue.js applications. It serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application, allowing them to access and modify the application's state in a predictable and consistent way.

Here's an overview of Vuex and its key concepts:

<b>1. State:</b> Vuex manages the state of a Vue.js application. The state is typically represented as a JavaScript object that contains data shared among multiple components.
  
<b>2. Getters:</b> Getters are functions in Vuex that allow components to retrieve and compute derived state from the Vuex store. They are useful for accessing specific pieces of state or performing computations on the state.

<b>3. Mutations:</b> Mutations are synchronous functions that are responsible for modifying the state in the Vuex store. They are the only way to change the state in a Vuex store, ensuring that state changes are explicit and predictable.

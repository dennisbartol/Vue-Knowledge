### Vite

Vite is a modern frontend build tool and development server designed for fast performance, especially for Vue 3 and other modern frameworks. Unlike Webpack, which bundles the entire app before serving, Vite leverages native ES modules to provide instant hot module replacement (HMR) and ultra-fast updates.

Key Features of Vite:

1. Blazing-Fast Dev Server – Uses ES modules for near-instant startup.


2. HMR (Hot Module Replacement) – Updates changes instantly without reloading.


3. Optimized Build – Uses Rollup for production, ensuring small and efficient bundles.


4. Out-of-the-Box Support – Works seamlessly with Vue, React, Svelte, and TypeScript.


5. Auto-Optimization – Pre-bundles dependencies using esbuild (much faster than Webpack’s Babel).



Why Use Vite Instead of Webpack?

Faster Development – No need for full re-bundling.

Better DX (Developer Experience) – Instant updates with minimal lag.

Simpler Configuration – Requires less setup compared to Webpack.


Example: Starting a Vue 3 Project with Vite

npm create vite@latest my-vue-app --template vue
cd my-vue-app
npm install
npm run dev

Vite is now the default for Vue 3 and is rapidly replacing Webpack for modern web development.

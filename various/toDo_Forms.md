### Vue Forms



Routing in Vue is used to navigate the Vue application, and it happens on the client side (in the browser) without full page reload, which results in a faster user experience.

Routing is a way to navigate, similar to how we have used dynamic components earlier.

With routing we can use the URL address to direct someone to a specific place in our Vue application.

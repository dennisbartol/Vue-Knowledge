<h4>Export Default in Vue</h4>


In Vue.js, `export default` is a feature of JavaScript's module system, not specifically tied to Vue itself, although it's commonly used in Vue components.

Here's what it does:

<b>1. Exporting:</b> It exports a single value or object as the default export from a module. This means that when another module imports from this module, it will receive whatever is exported as the default.

<b>2. Default Import:</b> When importing from a module that has a default export, you can import it without curly braces {}. For example:
<code>
// Exporting module
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      message: 'Hello'
    }
  }
}
</code>
Javascript:</br>
<code>
// Importing module
import MyComponent from './MyComponent.vue'

// Now MyComponent refers to the default export of MyComponent.vue
</code>

In Vue.js, 'export default' commonly <ins>used to export Vue components, allowing other parts of the application to import and use them easily</ins>. This is a convention in Vue.js projects, though you're not required to use it - you could use named exports and imports instead if you prefer.

<h4>Statefull and stateless components in Vue3</h4>


&nbsp;</br>

In Vue 3, stateless and stateful components refer to components' management of data (or "state"). Let's break down each type and their differences:


&nbsp;</br>
**Stateless Components**

Definition: Stateless components, also called "functional components," don’t manage any internal state. They rely solely on the data passed down from their parent components via props and don’t have reactive data of their own.

Use Case: These components are typically presentational, focusing solely on rendering UI based on the props they receive, which makes them reusable and easy to maintain.

Example:
```js
<template>
  <p>{{ message }}</p>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  props: {
    message: String,
  }
}
</script>
```

Here, message is a prop, and there’s no internal state.

**Stateful Components**

Definition: Stateful components manage internal state using Vue’s reactivity system, which allows them to track and modify data within the component. This state is usually defined using data, reactive, or ref.

Use Case: These components are ideal for handling complex interactions, like forms or components that require their own state management (e.g., managing inputs, modals).

Example:
```
<template>
  <div>
    <p>{{ count }}</p>
    <button @click="increment">Increment</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { ref } from 'vue';

export default {
  setup() {
    const count = ref(0);
    const increment = () => count.value++;
    return { count, increment };
  }
}
</script>
```

Here, count is a piece of reactive state that the component manages internally.

**Key Differences**

In general, stateless components are ideal for simple display elements, while stateful components work best for parts of an application that handle user interactions or have complex state management needs.
